## Features 

+ ### Task Types: To Dos, Deadlines, and Events

   There are 3 different types of tasks that can recorded by the task list: To Dos, Deadlines, and Events. All tasks are labelled with a task name. 

  1. **To Dos** : Regular task with no additional metadata.
  2. **Deadlines** : To keep track of deadlines, consists of due date and time metadata. 
  3. **Events** : To keep track of events, consists of event occurance data and time metadata.

+ ### Task List 

   This application has an in bult task list that keeps track of all tasks and their metadata. Each task is assigned an index number dependant on the time at which the task was added into the list, in ascending order. The task list also keeps track of the status of each task, if the task has been completed or not. Tasks can be mark as done, as well as removed from the list. The task list can be printed out into the GUI for user viewing, and the task list features a simple search function to search for tasks in the list.
   
+ ### Data Saving 

   When first using this application, a data file named `duke.txt` will be created alongside the executable, for storing data. If the file already exists within the working directory, the program will read the existing `duke.txt` file. 

   Data of the task list is written into `duke.txt` to be loaded into the application in every session. At the end of the session, all changes to the task list will be written back to `duke.txt` for use in subsequent sessions.

## Usage

This application is used through a command line interface. You are required to enter commands into a text box to add tasks and manipulate the task list. 

Entered commands will be echoed into the chat box, afterwhich, the application will output the outcome of your command.
